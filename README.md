# The Quatalog

The official RPI course catalog is well-known for being a garbage fire.
Often, its listed prerequisites and listed terms a course will be offered are inaccurate,
and many courses still listed in the catalog haven't been offered in years and effectively no longer exist.
The Quatalog aims to make course planning easier by providing accurate prerequiste data and data for when a
given course was offered in the past. The name comes from [QuACS](https://github.com/quacs/quacs), which is the [source of data](https://github.com/quacs/quacs-data) for this project.
